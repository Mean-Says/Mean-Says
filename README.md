## 🧠 Products I Own & Built

### 🧠 Thought — Intelligent Content Curation *(Owner)*  
🌐 https://thought.com.br/

- Understands content context beyond keywords
- Generates strategic, non-obvious questions using AI
- Helps users structure their own ideas into publishable formats (e.g. LinkedIn posts)

**My role:**
